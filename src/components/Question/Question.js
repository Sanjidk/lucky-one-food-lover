                <p className="card-text fw-bold"> 
                1. Props are immutable but State are mutable. <br />
                2. By Props, properties can pass from parent compunents but By State, it can define in the component itself. <br />
                3. Props can not be modified but State can be modified by using this.setState. <br />
                4. Props are read-only but State changes can be asynchronous. <br />
                5. Props remain static but State is updated by the object.
